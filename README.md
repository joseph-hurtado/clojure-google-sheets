# clojure-google-sheets

A clojure google sheets integration example, based on [java quickstart start](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/java) with way more examples.
This sample use a [ibovespa](http://www.b3.com.br/en_us/market-data-and-indices/indices/broad-indices/ibovespa.htm) prices [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNJ-c4qY3qZbnxTOaS9XsEnRJnO6_aO58V_e109U9Ig/edit#gid=0) where the first tab is the stocks prices to read second one is a simulation for stocks that we bought.

## Configuration and Running

[Video how to integrate using this repo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=posNZFWSEgU)

1. Access your [google console developers](https://console.developers.google.com/) and turn on the Google Sheets API and get credentials.json, find for "Authorized redirect URIs" and add `http://localhost:8888`
2. Add your credentials.json on [resources](./resources) path (you can find [template.credentials.json](./resources/template.credentials.json) as an example there)
3. good to go, just run `lein run`
4. A browser will open requesting your auth, accept it
5. You'll see the output of some [ibovespa](http://www.b3.com.br/en_us/market-data-and-indices/indices/broad-indices/ibovespa.htm) prices [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WNJ-c4qY3qZbnxTOaS9XsEnRJnO6_aO58V_e109U9Ig/edit#gid=0), and also simple response of write it means that it worked, eg:
```
Stock, Current Price
EMBR3, 6.49
HGTX3, 17.19
CIEL3, 3.93
UNIP6, 27.4

ALSO3, 24.33
CGRA4, 27.22
LEVE3, 17.77
ENEV3, 47.1
```

## Moving forward
Now that we can read at least a sample spreadsheet lets do more, but to do it, we'll start to use our [documentation](./doc/intro.md) see you there.

### Tests
```
lein test
```

### Tips

**sheet id**

sheet id is a range on a sheet. All indexes are zero-based. it means that a first sheet is 0.

The easiest way to find the sheet id is in the browser URL when you open the spreadsheet / sheet: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{spreadsheetId}/edit#gid={sheetId}`
more info regarding sheet cordinates see [here](https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/sheets/v4/csharp/latest/classGoogle_1_1Apis_1_1Sheets_1_1v4_1_1Data_1_1GridRange.html)
